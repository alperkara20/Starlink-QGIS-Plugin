Starlink QGIS Plugin
A QGIS plugin that allows users to select a specific geographical area on the QGIS map and displays the number of Starlink satellites currently orbiting over that area.

Installation
Download the plugin from the release page
In QGIS, go to Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins
Select Install from ZIP and choose the downloaded file
The plugin should now be installed and can be found in the Plugins menu
Usage
Open a new QGIS project or open an existing project
Go to Plugins > Starlink QGIS Plugin
Use the map tools to select a specific area on the map
Click the Search button to initiate the search
The plugin will display the number of Starlink satellites currently orbiting over the selected area
Data Source
The plugin uses TLE (Two-Line Elements) data as the primary data source. TLE data is a common format for representing the orbital elements of satellites and is publicly available from various sources. However, the use of TLE data does have some limitations.

The TLE data used in the plugin is based on a snapshot of the satellite orbits at a specific point in time, rather than live data. Therefore, the plugin is only able to provide information on the location and density of satellites at the time the TLE data was collected, rather than in real-time.

The TLE data used only contains information on the orbits of active satellites. The TLE data used in the plugin only includes information on satellites that are currently in orbit, and does not include information on inactive or decommissioned satellites.

Limitations
The plugin uses TLE data as the primary data source, which is not real-time data.

The plugin only covers the active satellite orbits, and does not include information on inactive or decommissioned satellites.
